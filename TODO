Simple fixes
------------
escape channel names when writing logs (#!/bin/mksh.txt is invalid)
redirect ChanServ messages that begin with "[#channel]" to the proper buffer

Difficult fixes
---------------
add messages to unread if away
Keep track of nickname's access across MODE changes
fix support for inputting multi-byte Unicode codepoints
fix the hundres of bugs present in the inputline code

New features
------------
add support for: WALLOPS, 322, 367, 368, 698
add commands for: /list, /quiet
last-read-message indicator
Show nickname's access in messages
Add undo, completion support to the termbox readline module

Long-term ideas/features
------------------------
Switch to ncurses
multi-server
Different command prefix to print command output in current buffer vs main buffer
	- maybe /:command for current buffer and /command for main buffer?
Show netsplits/netjoins as a single message (to avoid clogging buffers)
Support for mouse input (switching buffers, highlighting messages, etc)
Support for multi-codepoint Unicode graphemes

Code hygiene
------------
test suite for bookkeeping
tests for util.fold
manpage
