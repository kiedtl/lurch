Refactorings
------------
- move all state into a few globals, paving way for multi-server

Simple fixes
------------
- escape channel names when writing logs (#!/bin/mksh.txt is invalid)
- redirect ChanServ messages that begin with "[#channel]" to the proper buffer
- remove braindamaged away-notify thing
- show lots of buffers nicely in fancy statusline

Difficult fixes
---------------
- add messages to unread if away
- Keep track of nickname's access across MODE changes
- fix support for inputting multi-byte Unicode codepoints
- fix the hundres of bugs present in the inputline code
  - fix the cursor moving erratically on overfull inputlines

New features
------------
- add support for: WALLOPS, 322, 367, 368, 698, 005, 335 (whois is-a-bot)
- add commands for: /list, /quiet, /reload-config
- last-read-message indicator
- Show nickname's access in messages
- Add undo, completion support to the termbox readline module

Long-term ideas/features
------------------------
- Switch to ncurses
- multi-server
- Different command prefix to print command output in current buffer vs main buffer
	- maybe /:command for current buffer and /command for main buffer?
- Show netsplits/netjoins as a single message (to avoid clogging buffers)
- Support for mouse input (switching buffers, highlighting messages, etc)
- Support for multi-codepoint Unicode graphemes

Code hygiene
------------
- test suite for bookkeeping
- tests for util.fold
